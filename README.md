<center><b>An Python Program to Automatically Store Attendece using Face Recognition in an CSV file.</b></center>

I learned about python libraries such as face_recognition, cv2 and also about Importing Date and time into the python program and also about writing in an csv file.<br>
The Project helped me gain knowledge about these features offered by Python3.
